Hello, I'm Daniel, a software engineer based in the Karlsruhe area of Germany.
With years of experience, I've had the privilege of building software solutions
for clients across various domains. I am working for [andrena
objects](https://www.andrena.de/). My curiosity drives me to constantly learn
new things. When I'm not sitting in front of my devices, youâ€™ll find me
spending time with family, exploring the great outdoors or tinkering with home
improvement projects.
